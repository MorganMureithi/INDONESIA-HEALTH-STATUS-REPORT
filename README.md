**HIGHLIGHTS**
The report gives an overall status of the Helath Facilities in Indonesia
It shows the distribution of Facilities,across Regions/Provinces
Additionally,it shows the dsitribution of speciality facilities to least special facilities(those that offer Basic Medical Services)
Moreover,it gives insights to bed capacity of various levels of speciality Hospitals.
Finally,it shows how Healthcare resource man power has also been distributed across hospitals classfication


**RECOMMENDATIONS**
Even though I'm neither a resident nor an Indonesian national,this report can be beneficial to the Health Authority,Stakeholders including Professional Bodies in Indonesia,to 
assess the nation path to achieving Universal Health Care.
This can realized through the following pointers:
1.It can show whether there is an imbalanced distribution of Heath facilities,especially for Levels C and D,that offer the most Heatlh care services and are the primary first point of contact of a resident/national seeking health care services,repesctively 
A balanced distribution of priary health care facilities(Level D facilities) and Level C facilties,can help interrogate Indonesia'a abilty to deal with a burdened healthcare emergency e.g Pandemics,Outbreak
that in most cases,tend to put stress in many health care capacities of other countries
2.In referrence to point 1 immediately above,bed capacity as an independent metric measure to Indonesia's journey in acheieving Universal Health Coverage is important,especially for Levels C and D
Normally,incase of a health issue,most patients may require routine checkups/follow up,thus many not having the need to seek speciality care.
Therefore,the distribution and amount of beds in Levels C and D is crucial in asessing it ability to take in a number of patients incase of a health pandemic.
This,is to be measured according to the population size of each province,preferrably
As the accessability of health facilities is crucial to the population and the bed capacity of these facilities,so is those required to provide needful services in these facilities
The data can be used to determine personnel gaps within the health system,especially across speciality 

**LIMITATIONS OF THE DATA**
1.Absence of Population data:this measure is important as it would have helped precisely dtermine provinces where health facilities are in acute presence,
bed to population ratio and also workforce to a person in the population
2.Abscence of speciality cadres with the number of healthcare personnel in those speciality:it will be helpful to find out the speciality that are in low numbers in Indonesia
This information will inform training for specialisations with least members in Indonesia
